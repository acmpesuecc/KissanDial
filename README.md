# KissanDial - MCP-Powered Agricultural Assistant

KissanDial is a cutting-edge voice call-based AI agent assistant designed to empower farmers by providing them with vital information on agricultural subsidies, weather updates, and market prices. Built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, KissanDial offers real-time access to government schemes, dynamic data integration, and SMS notifications to bridge the information gap for farmers.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Capabilities
1. **🌾 Government Subsidy Information**: Access to 14+ real government schemes including PM-KISAN, PMFBY, KCC, and more
2. **📊 Real-time Data Integration**: Live updates from Data.gov API and government portals
3. **📱 SMS Notifications**: Detailed scheme information sent via SMS with helpline numbers
4. **🗣️ Voice Interface**: Natural language processing for farmer queries in multiple contexts
5. **🔄 Dynamic Content**: Real-time scheme status checks and live data fetching

### MCP Integration Benefits
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new data sources and capabilities
- **Standardized Protocol**: Uses Model Context Protocol for seamless LLM integration
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Connects to government APIs, local databases, and external services
- **Community Ready**: Compatible with community-built MCP servers

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **🤖 LLM**: Gemini 2.0 Flash / GPT-4 (configurable)
- **🔗 MCP**: Model Context Protocol for standardized data access
- **📞 Twilio**: Voice calls and SMS notifications
- **🐍 Python**: LlamaIndex for agent pipeline management
- **🌐 APIs**: Data.gov, government portals, real-time data sources

## Identified Problems

During our discussions with 4-5 farmers, we identified several key challenges:

1. **Urgent Need for Cost-Saving Measures**: Farmers require ways to reduce costs in their operations.
2. **Limited Access to Subsidy and Weather Information**: There is a significant gap in the timely availability of important information.
3. **Reliance on Word-of-Mouth for Subsidy Details**: Farmers often depend on informal networks to learn about subsidies.
4. **Outdated and Localized Information**: The information available is often not up-to-date or is localized, limiting its usefulness.
5. **Lack of Easy Access to Online Resources**: Many farmers struggle with accessing online platforms for information.

## Solution

KissanDial addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, easily accessible platform for farmers to obtain accurate and timely information. By leveraging advanced technologies, KissanDial ensures that farmers receive up-to-date details to support their agricultural decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Call Assistance**: Farmers can call KissanDial to inquire about subsidies, weather updates, and more. The AI agent, powered by GPT-4, understands their queries and provides appropriate responses.
2. **SMS Follow-Up**: After the call, detailed information is sent via SMS to the farmer for future reference.
3. **Continuous Updates**: The system is regularly updated to ensure that the information provided is current and accurate.

KissanDial is dedicated to supporting farmers by providing the information they need to succeed in their agricultural endeavors.

## � MCP Architecture Overview

### What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is an open standard that allows AI applications to securely connect to external data sources. In KissanDial:

```
📞 Farmer Query → 🤖 Agent → 🔧 MCP Bridge → 🌾 Subsidy Server → 🌐 Government APIs
                    ↓
📱 SMS Response ← 🤖 Agent ← 🔧 MCP Tools ← 📊 Real Data ← 🔄 Live Updates
```

### MCP Components in KissanDial

   - `subsidy_mcp.py`: Main server with 7 agricultural tools
   - Connects to Data.gov API, PM-KISAN, Digital India portals
   - Handles 14+ verified government schemes

2. **MCP Bridge** (`tools/mcp_bridge_simple.py`):
   - Converts MCP tools to LlamaIndex-compatible format
   - Manages server lifecycle and error handling
   - Enables seamless tool integration

3. **Agent Integration** (`app/agent_mcp.py`):
   - Uses MCP tools transparently
   - Processes voice input and generates responses
   - Sends SMS with dynamic subsidy information
